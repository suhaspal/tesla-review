This project provides a complete pipeline for building a hand gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. 
It enables you to:
 - Collect gesture images via webcam
 - Extract hand landmarks and prepare a dataset
 - Train a machine learning model
 - Run real-time gesture recognition

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
MediaPipe
scikit-learn
numpy
